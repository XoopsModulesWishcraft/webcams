Many thanks for setting up your webcam studio account. You will have to download Just Cam It from www.istreaming.com. However your account is still waiting for approval before it will ensure you are able to use this title. You will recieve an email when you account is APPROVED!

Once you have downloaded this, the following details will allow you to connect to the system and broadcast your webcam in the chat rooms. This is currently only available for Windows unfortunately we do not have clients for Linux or Mac.
